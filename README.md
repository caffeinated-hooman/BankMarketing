# Bank Marketing prediction model
### This main objective of this project is to adopt a data driven approach to analyzing bank loan data and upscale bank telemarketing. 

## Project Definition
### Predict if a client will subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit â€” this is defined as a classification problem.

## About the dataset
### There's a mix of categorical and numerical columns in the data so the data has been split accordingly. 
### Heres a link to the dataset that's being used in this project. [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing]
### The data that is used in this project originally comes from the UCI machine learning repository.This dataset is related contains about 40,000 direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution from May 2008 to November 2010. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls and more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the customer would open a term deposit in the bank or not. 


## Notebook walkthrough
### - Data exploration and understanding using visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn)
### - Feature Engineering : classifying features such as numerial and categorical into groups in order to analyze the data for results in machine learning algorithms
### - Gradient boosting algorithm model prediction (scikit-learn)
### - Model performance evaluation
